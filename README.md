## Hi there 👋 I'm Gregory Ditter

I'm transitioning from 13+ years in logistics leadership into IT and software development.

- 🐍 Python developer (automation / data handling / reporting)
- ⚙ Background: team lead / logistics department manager
- 🚀 Goal: build tools that remove manual work and make operations smarter
- 🎯 Long-term: freelance / self-employed in process automation

---

### 🔭 What I'm working on right now
- `Employee Birthday & Anniversary Report System`  
  A FastAPI/Python tool that generates monthly birthday & work-anniversary reports for HR/management using CSV data.

- Learning FastAPI, pytest, Docker, and CI/CD to build production-quality services.

---

### 🧠 My strengths
- I understand real business problems from the inside (shift planning, people, stress, deadlines).
- I can translate those problems into code.
- I care about reliability more than “cool tech.”

This is not just a career change. It's ownership of my future.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I’m not coming from theory.  
I’ve led people, solved problems under pressure, and now I'm turning that into software.
